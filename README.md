# Security and Kernel Configurations

due to bios being backleveled, i had to make adjustments, cannot make adjustments on the fly... who am I? McFly from Back To The Future?

Learning experiences tend to happen, brace yourself for soft ejection. 


to do:
reupdate kernel perams when bios is updated
reinstall sys
reconfigure
repost
